                <p>We may collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when you:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Create an account on the Site</li>

                <p>
                    You may be asked for, as appropriate, your full name, email address, billing address, profile image,
                    telephone number, a unique individual username and password, and/or social media handles. You may visit
                    our Site anonymously, but functionality may be limited, as some areas of the Site can only be accessed
                    while logged into an account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you first log onto our Site, you will have the opportunity to create an account. You do not need
                    an account or to provide any information to us if you are just browsing the publicly accessible portion
                    of the Site, but if you want to make a donation, follow other people, comment, and/or view content that
                    other people have chosen to restrict, then you must create an account, which entails providing us with
                    your first and last name, your email address, and month and year of birth. If you donate, you will also
                    need to provide your payment information through one of our secure payment processors. Make Sure It Happens Inc. only
                    keeps a record of your transactionâ€”credit card and bank account details are held by our third-party
                    payment processor, not by Make Sure It Happens Inc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you create an account with us, you can do so either directly through the Site by providing us a
                    username and password, or through a third-party sign-in, such as Facebook Connect. If you choose to use
                    any of the third-party sign-up/sign-in processes, you are giving us permission to see information contained
                    in your public profile on those sites. If you do not want us to have access to such information, please
                    sign up with msih.org directly rather than using a third-party sign-in.

                <p>
                    When you interact with our Site, we also collect limited non-personally identifying information that the
                    browser you used makes available automatically. This information includes the internet address of the
                    computer or network you used to access our Site, the date, time, and page(s) you visited on our Site,
                    the browser and operating system you used, and the referring page (the webpage that contained the link to
                    our Site that you clicked on to get there). We also use data files to help you navigate the Site.

                    We also collect various data from public sources, such as social media, government databases, and other
                    websites, though we do not associate such data with individual users of the Site. However, please note
                    that if you sign in with Facebook connect or another third-party login provider, we may link any data
                    we receive through that connection with your account.

                <h2>Use of Data</h2>
                <p>
                    We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that our Site operates correctly and efficiently. Toward that
                    goal, we use the aggregated non-personal data and information from all users of our Site to measure server
                    performance, analyze user traffic patterns, and improve the content of our Site and portions of our Site.
                    We may use this anonymized data for research purposes as well, including sharing it with academic researchers.
                    We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engines or through our Site to measure
                    interest in specific topics and to improve the visitor experience on the Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have a legitimate interest in communicating with you about your account and will use your personal
                    information to send you important non-commercial emails, such as administrative notices related to our
                    Site, your donations, and customer service inquiries. For instance, you may receive an email receipt
                    for donations you make on the Site. This and other noncommercial information is necessary to maintain
                    our records. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving marketing messages (see below for details),
                    we will still send you these types of administrative messages (unless you delete your account, of course).
                </p>

                <p class="fw-bold">We do not sell your personal information.</p>

                <p>
                    With your consent, as noted above, we will use your email address and/or other personal information to
                    provide you with information we think you will be interested in, including, but not limited to, news,
                    updates, information about nonprofits you may be interested in, and updates on people and nonprofits
                    that you follow. Even after you have agreed to receive such messages, you can let us know at any time
                    if you would prefer not to receive any or all of this information by updating your profile settings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As noted above, even if you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we will still send you important
                    non-commercial messages so long as you maintain your account. Please see below for how to permanently
                    delete your account.

                    In the event that Make Sure It Happens Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation,
                    or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your data will, in most instances, be part of the assets
                    transferred. You may be notified of any such business transition via email and/or notice on the Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have a legitimate interest in complying with our legal obligations. Accordingly, we may release personal
                    information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a
                    valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect our
                    rights, property, or safety, or that of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers, or others.

                <p>
                    Make Sure It Happens Inc. may also use third parties to process your data when it serves a legitimate business purpose
                    (such as technical support, customer support, and financial institutions). Our contracts with these
                    third-party processors require them to comply with the terms and intent of this privacy policy and
                    make commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard your information.
                </p>

                <h2>Donation Process</h2>
                <p>
                    You may donate by providing payment information directly on the msih.org site (which is powered by
                    third-party vendors with whom we have an agreement). When you input your credit card or bank account
                    information on the Site, it goes directly to our vendors for processing. We only maintain a record of
                    the transaction, not your credit card or bank account details.
                </p>

                <h2>Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Site may contain links to other sites, including sites for other nonprofit entities or other forms
                    of philanthropic endeavor. Those sites may have their own privacy policies, or no privacy policies at all.
                    Make Sure It Happens Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites, and those other sites have
                    not agreed to our privacy policy. Make Sure It Happens Inc. has no control over or responsibility for any unaffiliated
                    third-party sites or the content contained in them, and we provide these links solely for the convenience
                    of our visitors. We do not sponsor, endorse, or otherwise recommend such sites or any products or services
                    they may offer. In short, once you leave our Site, we are no longer responsible for the data collection
                    practices of the companies operating those sites. This is not to say we have any reason not to trust them;
                    we just can't vouch for them, as we are sure you can understand.

                <h2>Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    The Site may use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and/or other Google Analytics for
                    Display Advertising features, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and/or
                    the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration. We are required by Google to disclose the following information
                    to you in our Privacy Statement in connection with our use of any Google Analytics for Display Advertising
                    features on the Digital Properties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by
                    using the Google Ads Settings page. You may also prevent your data from being collected and used by
                    Google Analytics by opting out through the use of the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. If the
                    Site makes use of the Google Analytics for Display Advertising Remarketing feature, Make Sure It Happens Inc.
                    will use such Remarketing feature to advertise online, and third-party vendors, including Google, may show
                    Make Sure It Happens Inc. ads on sites across the Internet.
                </p>



                <p>
                    Make Sure It Happens Inc. and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google
                    Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to (a) inform,
                    optimize and serve ads based on a user's past visits to the Site, and/or (b) report how your ad impressions,
                    other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits
                    to the Site.

                <p>
                    Because the do-not-track signal does not often reflect the preference of our consumers, our website does
                    not respond to it. You may, however, elect not to receive marketing messages and/or have certain cookies
                    placed on your browser, as discussed above in the Cookies section of this Policy.

                <p>
                    Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its revisions in 2013, our website
                    is a general audience website, intended for adult use only. Make Sure It Happens Inc. does not market to children under
                    the age of thirteen, nor does it knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children
                    under the age of thirteen. You may only use our Site if you are over the age at which you can provide
                    consent to data processing under the laws of your country (the "Age of Consent").

                    users happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
                    We exercise reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission
                    over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your non-public personal
                    information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us while
                    it is in transit. Once we receive your personal information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
                    safeguards to protect it. If a data breach occurs, we will notify you and the proper EEA authority (if required)
                    within 72 hours (if reasonably feasible). If we are unable to notify the proper EEA authority within 72 hours,
                    our notice will be accompanied by reasons for the delay.
