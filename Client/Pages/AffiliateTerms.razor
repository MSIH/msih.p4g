                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
                <h3>Payment Schedule</h3>
                <ul>

                        Payments are based on qualified user conversions received by MSIH during the previous quarter. A "qualified conversion" means a user who both:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creates an account using your referral code, AND</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>First payment eligibility begins in the quarter following your first qualifying user sign-up</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Payment Requirements</h3>

                    <li><strong>Complete age verification:</strong> You must provide accurate age information and be at least 13 years old</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide address information:</strong> You must provide a valid mailing address for tax reporting purposes</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payments are processed via Venmo or PayPal only</li>
                    <li>Payment information must be updated and verified before each payment cycle</li>
                    <li>MSIH is not responsible for failed payments due to incorrect or outdated payment information</li>
                    <li>Processing fees, if any, will be deducted from the affiliate fee payment</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Fee Forfeiture</h2>
                <p class="alert alert-warning">

                </p>

                <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
                <h3>Age and Legal Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be at least 13 years old</li>
                    <li>Must be legally authorized to work in the United States</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Valid email address</li>
                    <li>Content to receive email communication</li>

                    <li>Current mailing address for tax documentation</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Referral Code Usage</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each affiliate receives a unique referral code</li>
                    <li>Users must use your specific referral code for sign-ups to count toward your fee calculation</li>
                    <li>Referral codes cannot be shared, transferred, or used by other individuals</li>
                    <li>Misuse of referral codes may result in immediate program termination</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Qualifying Conversions</h2>
                <p>
                    Affiliate fees are earned only for qualified conversions, not merely account creation.
                    A qualified conversion requires both:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Registration:</strong> User creates an account using your unique referral code</li>
                    <li><strong>Account Activation:</strong> User successfully logs into their account at least once</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Account creation alone, without the user logging in, does not earn affiliate fees. This ensures affiliate payments are based on genuine user engagement rather than inactive accounts.
                </p>

                <h2>Tax Reporting</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are responsible for reporting all affiliate fee income on your tax returns</li>
                    <li>MSIH will issue Form 1099-NEC for annual payments exceeding $600</li>
                    <li>W-9 forms must be completed before payments exceeding $600 are processed</li>
                    <li>Address information is required for proper tax reporting</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Program Termination</h2>
                <p>MSIH reserves the right to terminate your participation in the affiliate program at any time for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violation of these terms or our general Terms of Service</li>
                    <li>Fraudulent or misleading marketing practices</li>
                    <li>Failure to maintain required account information</li>
                    <li>Any conduct deemed harmful to MSIH's reputation or mission</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Upon termination, you forfeit any unpaid affiliate fees and lose access to your referral code.</p>

                <h2>Compliance with General Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    These Affiliate Terms supplement and do not replace our general Terms of Service. All affiliates must also comply with our Code of Conduct, Privacy Policy, and all other applicable terms. In case of conflict, these Affiliate Terms take precedence for affiliate-specific matters.
                </p>
