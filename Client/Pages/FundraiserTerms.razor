                <h2>Fundraiser Program Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Make Sure It Happens Inc ("MSIH") offers a fundraiser program where qualified individuals can earn marketing fees by promoting donations through their social networks using assigned referral codes. By participating in this program, you agree to these specific terms in addition to our general Terms of Service.
                </p>

                <h2>Marketing Fee Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    MSIH pays fundraisers a tiered marketing fee structure based on the total annual donations generated through their referral code. Fees are earned only when donation thresholds are fully reached and donations are actually received by MSIH.
                </p>
