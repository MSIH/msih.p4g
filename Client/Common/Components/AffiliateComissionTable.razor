        <h2>Affiliate Fee Structure</h2>
        <p class="description">
            A tiered affiliate fee structure based on qualified users creating accounts, with three initial milestones followed by recurring $35 fees for every additional 5 qualified user accounts created. Fees are earned only when user sign-up thresholds are fully reached.
        </p>

        <p>The first three levels offer increasing rewards as you build momentum. Once you hit 5 qualified users, the pattern becomes straightforward - you receive an affiliate fee of $35 for every additional 5 qualified users that sign up.</p>

        <p>For example, if you generate 17 qualified user sign-ups, you will earn an affiliate fee of $105 ($15 + $10 + $10 + $35 + $35) because you've completed levels 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 qualified users.</p>

        <p>For example, if you generate 100 qualified user sign-ups, you will receive total affiliate fees of $700. For 1,000 qualified user sign-ups, you will receive total affiliate fees of $7,000. For 5,000 qualified user sign-ups, you will receive total affiliate fees of $35,000.</p>
