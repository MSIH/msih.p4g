        <p class="description">
            A tiered Marketing Fee structure based on donor sign-ups with three initial milestones, followed by recurring $35 fees for every additional 5 donors. Fees are earned only when donor thresholds are fully reached.

        <div class="example">
            <p>The first three levels offer increasing rewards as you build momentum. Once you hit 5 donors, the pattern becomes straightforward - you receive a marketing fee of $35 for every additional 5 donors that sign up.</p>
            <p>For example, if you generate 17 donor sign-ups, you will earn a marketing fee of $105 ($15 + $10 + $10 + $35 + $35) because you've completed levels (1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 donors).</p>
            <p>For example, if you generate 100 donor sign-ups, you will receive total marketing fees of $700. For 1,000 donor sign-ups, you will receive total marketing fees of $7,000. For 5,000 donor sign-ups, you will receive total marketing fees of $35,000.</p>
