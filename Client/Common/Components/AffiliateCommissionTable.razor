    <h5>Affiliate Fee Structure</h5>
    <p class="description">
        A tiered affiliate fee structure based on qualified user conversions, with one initial milestone followed by recurring $35 fees for every additional 5 qualified conversions. Fees are earned only when conversion thresholds are fully reached. A qualified conversion requires both user registration with your referral code AND the user successfully logging into their account.
    </p>
    <p>The first levels offer a reward as you build momentum. Once you hit 5 qualified conversions, the pattern becomes straightforward - you receive an affiliate fee of $35 for every additional 5 qualified conversions.</p>
    <p>For example, if you generate 17 qualified conversions, you will earn an affiliate fee of $105 ($10 + $25 + $35 + $35) because you've completed levels 3, 5, 10, and 15 qualified conversions.</p>
    <p>For example, if you generate 100 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $700. For 1,000 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $7,000. For 5,000 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $35,000.</p>
