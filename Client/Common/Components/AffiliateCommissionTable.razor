        <h2>Affiliate Fee Structure</h2>
        <p class="description">
            A tiered affiliate fee structure based on qualified user conversions, with three initial milestones followed by recurring $35 fees for every additional 5 qualified conversions. Fees are earned only when conversion thresholds are fully reached. A qualified conversion requires both user registration with your referral code AND the user successfully logging into their account.
        </p>
        <p>The first three levels offer increasing rewards as you build momentum. Once you hit 5 qualified conversions, the pattern becomes straightforward - you receive an affiliate fee of $35 for every additional 5 qualified conversions.</p>
        <p>For example, if you generate 17 qualified conversions, you will earn an affiliate fee of $105 ($15 + $10 + $10 + $35 + $35) because you've completed levels 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 qualified conversions.</p>
        <p>For example, if you generate 100 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $700. For 1,000 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $7,000. For 5,000 qualified conversions, you will receive total affiliate fees of $35,000.</p>
